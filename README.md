# 🍕🚴‍♂️ Food Delivery Time Prediction using Machine Learning 🕒

## 📋 Overview  
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict the estimated delivery time for food orders, just like popular platforms **Zomato** and **Swiggy**. The model considers multiple factors, such as:  
- 👷 **Age of Delivery Partner**  
- ⭐ **Ratings of Previous Deliveries**  
- 📏 **Total Distance**  

## 🎯 Objective  
To help predict **accurate delivery times** for customer orders, improving **user experience** and platform efficiency.

## 🔧 Project Components  

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing  
- 🗑️ Cleaning and handling missing data.  
- ⚙️ Feature engineering for deriving useful insights.  
- 📊 Scaling features to ensure balanced model performance.

### 🧠 Model Development  
- Selecting regression models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **Neural Networks**.  
- Training the model with a **dataset of past deliveries**.  

### 📈 Performance Evaluation  
- Measuring performance with:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ✅  
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** 📉

## 🖥️ Example: Testing the Model  

Here’s how you can test the model:  

```python
import numpy as np

print("🚚🍔 Food Delivery Time Prediction")
a = int(input("👷 Age of Delivery Partner: "))
b = float(input("⭐ Ratings of Previous Deliveries: "))
c = int(input("📏 Total Distance: "))

# Prepare features for prediction
features = np.array([[a, b, c]])

# Predict delivery time
predicted_time = model.predict(features)
print("⏱️ Predicted Delivery Time in Minutes = ", predicted_time)
```

### Sample Run  
**Input**:  
```
👷 Age of Delivery Partner: 27  
⭐ Ratings of Previous Deliveries: 4.5  
📏 Total Distance: 6  
```

**Output**:  
```
⏱️ Predicted Delivery Time in Minutes = [[24.21]]
```
